title: "Strategy is your Words by Mark Pollard"

discription: Mark Pollard helps leaders, marketers, and agencies get out of their heads and into the wild using a combination of training, strategy, and writing. He needed a new website to house his essays, resources, and podcast and wanted something that felt both literary and quirky. I designed and developed a simple, typographic-led website that put Mark's content, blending clean design and hand-drawn elements.
