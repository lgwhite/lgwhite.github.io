title: "Behavior Map and Observational Research"
tags: Design
discription: The objective was to observe a public location and record interactions then design a behavior map. A classmate and I collaborated to record observations of groups at Calmo Coffee over a two-hour period. We tracked the frequency of distractions while people worked, noting instances of fidgeting, phone usage, and other interruptions.
