title: "Forever Fractals Experimental Poster Design"
tags: Design
discription: For my special topics course in poster design, we were asked to create a poster with a motion element. I chose to explore the concept of infinity through fractals, learning p5.js to generate dynamic fractal designs. Using Photomosh, I refined these visuals into both static and animated forms, and then incorporated an augmented reality layer via Artivive to bring the poster to life. To heighten the effect, I provided 3D glasses during my graduate salon and in-class critiques, further distorting the viewing experience and making the exploration of infinity feel more unsettling. The speculative design aspect—pushing viewers to confront the endless nature of fractals—was the most fascinating part of this project for me, as it opened up new ways to perceive and engage with the infinite.
