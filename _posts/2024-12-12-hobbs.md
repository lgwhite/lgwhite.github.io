title: "Immersive National Park Poster for Hobbs State Park-Conservation Area"
tags: Design
discription: For my special topics course in poster design, the assignment was to celebrate the significance of U.S. parks by creating a poster. I chose Hobbs State Park—my closest local park—and explored ways to capture its multisensory essence. Using digital photography, handheld and flatbed scanning, and a Playtronica board to record audio signals, I combined imagery, texture, and sound to reveal the park’s natural complexity. Each texture was scanned and photographed directly from Hobbs State Park, and each wave pattern and data visualization was generated by the electrical signals processed through the Playtronica board. By transforming those signals into frequencies, I was able to represent sensory elements of the park that often go unnoticed. These are sensations usually felt, not seen. The result is a poster that celebrates the beauty of the park while inviting viewers to experience a more immersive, tactile, and auditory connection. My process—from concept to final design—is documented in a short video.
